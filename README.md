# track-work
A very simple work tracking cli utility

## Requirements 
Rust's ```cargo``` build tool 

## Install
1. Run ```cargo install --git https://github.com/eywat/track-work.git```
2. (optional) set the env ```TRACK_WORK_FILE``` to access the intended storage file w/o needing to specify it via a cli arg

## Usage 
If installed as described above, a executable called ```track-work``` should be added to cargo's default install directory. See [cargo install docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-install.html).

See ```track-work --help``` for the available commands.
